<abstract>
<t>This document is a compilation of issues found since the publication of
RFC4960 in September 2007 based on experience with
implementing, testing, and using SCTP along with the suggested fixes.
This document provides deltas to RFC4960 and is organized in a time based way.
The issues are listed in the order they were brought up.
Because some text is changed several times the last delta in the text is the
one which should be applied.
In addition to the delta a description of the problem and the details of the
solution are also provided.</t>

<section anchor='intro' title='Introduction'>
<t>This document contains a compilation of all defects found up until
the publishing of this document for <xref target="RFC4960"/> specifying the
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).
These defects may be of an editorial or technical nature.
This document may be thought of as a companion document to be used in
the implementation of SCTP to clarify errors in the original SCTP document.</t>
<t>This document provides a history of the changes that will be compiled
into a BIS document for <xref target="RFC4960"/>. It is structured similar
to <xref target="RFC4460"/>.</t>

<t>Each error will be detailed within this document in the form of:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>The problem description,</t>
<t>The text quoted from <xref target="RFC4960"/>,</t>
<t>The replacement text that should be placed into an upcoming BIS document,</t>
<t>A description of the solution.</t>
</list></t>
<t>Note that when reading this document one must use care to assure that a field
or item is not updated further on within the document.
Each section should be applied in sequence to the original <xref target="RFC4960"/>
since this document is a historical record of the sequential changes that have
been found necessary at various inter-op events and through discussion on the
list.</t>

<section title='Path Error Counter Threshold Handling'>
<!-- http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=1440 -->

<section title='Description of the Problem'>
<t>The handling of the 'Path.Max.Retrans' parameter is described in
Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 of <xref target="RFC4960"/> in an Inconsistent
way. Whereas Section 8.2 describes that a path is marked inactive when
the path error counter exceeds the threshold, Section 8.3 says the path
is marked inactive when the path error counter reaches the threshold.</t>

Errata ID 1440.</t>

Old text: (Section 8.3)
---------

When the value of this counter reaches the protocol parameter
'Path.Max.Retrans', the endpoint should mark the corresponding
destination address as inactive if it is not so marked, and may also
optionally report to the upper layer the change of reachability of
this destination address.  After this, the endpoint should continue
HEARTBEAT on this destination address but should stop increasing the
counter.

Old text: (Section 6.1 A))

The sender MUST also have an algorithm for sending new DATA chunks
to avoid silly window syndrome (SWS) as described in [RFC0813].
The algorithm can be similar to the one described in Section
4.2.3.4 of [RFC1122].

However, regardless of the value of rwnd (including if it is 0),
the data sender can always have one DATA chunk in flight to the
receiver if allowed by cwnd (see rule B below).  This rule allows
the sender to probe for a change in rwnd that the sender missed
due to the SACK having been lost in transit from the data receiver
to the data sender.

association overall error counter. In some circumstances, e.g.
when a router discards DATA chunks but not HEARTBEAT chunks due to
the larger size of the DATA chunk, it might be better to not clear
the association error counter on reception of the HEARTBEAT ACK and

optionally report to the upper layer when an inactive destination

An endpoint should limit the number of retransmissions of the
SHUTDOWN chunk to the protocol parameter 'Association.Max.Retrans'.
If this threshold is exceeded, the endpoint should destroy the TCB
and SHOULD report the peer endpoint unreachable to the upper layer
(and thus the association enters the CLOSED state).

The sender of the SHUTDOWN ACK should limit the number of
retransmissions of the SHUTDOWN ACK chunk to the protocol parameter
'Association.Max.Retrans'.  If this threshold is exceeded, the
endpoint should destroy the TCB and may report the peer endpoint
unreachable to the upper layer (and thus the association enters the
CLOSED state).
